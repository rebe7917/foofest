      We have five different camping areas Svartheim, Nilfheim, Helheim, Muspelheim og Alfheim located around the
      festival square, so it allows you to be close to the action. In each camping area there are a variety of food
      options, small shops, toilets, showers and interactive activities. When you buy your festival ticket you can add
      camping for 99,- as well as other benefits to make your camping experience even better.
